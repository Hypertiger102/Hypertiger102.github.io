    <h1>The Solo Queue Clam Blitz Experience</h1>
    <h2>By Lloyd Sagawa</h2>
    <p>For this final project, I decided to make an edited video for my Youtube channel seeing how I am a content creator and all. That being said, in this project I used Audacity to record my videoâ€™s intro, I used OBS studio to record my gameplay and voice audio, and then I mashed them all together in my editing software that I use which is known as Videopad Pro, and polished the intro in Adobe After Effects. I also had a friend of mine help me with the project by watching me edit it and helping me see what clips made the video flow better. The topic that I made this video about is a game mode in a game known as Splatoon 2. In the game, You play as inklings who are kids who can turn into squids and have weapons that they use to paint the floor with. Not only is there turf war for regular battles, but there are 4 modes for ranked battles as well, being Splat Zones, Tower Control, Rainmaker, and Clam Blitz, which was introduced in this game. Of these 4, the mode I decided to focus on for this project is Clam Blitz. This is because I haven't touched it in ranked before, so it would be a new experience for me. In the end, it was a fun ride, and I eventually did hit my goal of getting to S rank, which is the second highest rank in the game, before X rank, which is the highest. In conclusion, I had a ton of fun recording and editing this project, and I can't wait to see how my skills as a content creator grow as i go farther into this hobby!</p>
